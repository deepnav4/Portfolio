        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology at Dr. B.R. Ambedkar National Institute of Technology Jalandhar. My journey into technology began with a solid academic foundation, which has fueled my passion for this dynamic field. At NIT Jalandhar, I am deeply engaged in various aspects of Information Technology, including coding, software development, and emerging technologies.<br/><br/>
My curiosity drives me to continually learn and stay updated with the latest trends and advancements. In addition to my studies, I actively participate in projects and extracurricular activities that allow me to apply my skills and collaborate with peers. I have a keen interest in Full Stack Development and look forward to contributing to meaningful tech solutions.<br/><br/>
While I may be a bit reserved, I genuinely enjoy discussing technology and sharing ideas. Please feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or explore potential collaborations—I would love to hear from you!
